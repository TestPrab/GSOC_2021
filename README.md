# GSOC_2021

All the work done during Google Summer of Code 2021, in BRL CAD organization for the [Project Topic](https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/41).
<br>
During the period of the project, I was responsible for the following tasks:

1. Updating the BCFXML library to support version 3.0 of the bcf xsds.
2. Implementing BCF API Version 3.0 .
3. Creating a Test Server to test the implementation of the BCF API.

The [BCFXML library](/bcf/v3/bcfxml.py) is a library that provides a set of functions to read and write BCF files.

The [BCF API](/bcf/v3/bcfapi.py) is a set of functions that allow to read and write BCF files.

The [Test Server](/foundationserver/bcfserver) is a server that allows to test the implementation of the BCF API.
